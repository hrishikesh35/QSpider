variables:
1. var


2. LET:
    -> It is a local variable and does not allow redeclaration.
    -> We can change the value of the Let variable but can't reintialize them.

3. CONST
    -> Const can be declared and initialized in a single line.
    -> We cannot reintialize or redeclare const variable.



DATA TYPES:
There are two types of data types
A. Premitive datatype (IMMUTABLE)
    1. Number:
        Example:
        var hrishi = 23.11;
        console.log(hrishi);
        console.log(typeof hrishi);

        * typeof:
          This operator helps to see the datatype inside the memory.

    2. String:
        Example:
        var name = "hrishi";
        var institution = "Q-Spiders"
        console.log("Hello I am " + name + ". I am from " + institution.);
        console.log(`hello i am ${name} I am from ${institution}`);

    3. Boolean:
        Example:
        var a = true;
        console.log(a);
        console.log(typeof a);

    4. Undefined:
        Example:
        var name;
        console.log(name);

        -> JS gives a value as Undefined when a memory is created or variable is declared.

    5. NULL:
        The value given by the user to make a memory empty.
        data type of NULL is Object.

        Example:
        var hello = null;
        console.log(hello);
        console.log(typeof hello);

    6. Bigint:
        This datatype takes number which is less than -(2^53-1) or more than (2^53-1).
        We can use Bigint to store number beyond the range by suffixing the number with n.
        Example:
        var a = 1n;
        console.log(typeof a);

B. Non-Premitive datatype (MUTABLE)




HOISTING:
    JS allows a programmer to use a variable before the declaration is known as HOISTING.
    using variable before declarationis Hoising.

    * Hoising happens only for VAR variable.*
    *Temporal Dead Zone:
        The time taken between variable declaration and variable initialization 
        in the local variable (LET and CONST) is Temporal Dead Zone*

    Example:
    a = 22;
    console.log(a);
    var a;
    console.log(a);
