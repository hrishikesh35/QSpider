                <h2><dd> <b>Superman's</b> origin story involves his birth on the planet <a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Krypton">Krypton</a>, 
                        where his parents sent him to Earth as an infant in a rocket ship just before their planet was destroyed. 
                        He was adopted and raised by the Kents, a farming family in <a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Smallville,_Kansas">Smallville</a>, Kansas, 
                        and grew up with a strong moral compass and a desire to use his powers to help others.

                    <p> Superman possesses a wide range of superhuman abilities, 
                        including super strength, speed, durability, and senses. 
                        He can also fly, has heat vision, and can freeze objects with his breath. 
                        His one major weakness is exposure to <a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Kryptonite">Kryptonite</a>, 
                        a radioactive element from his home planet that can weaken and even kill him.</p>

                    <p> Superman is a symbol of hope and justice, and his alter ego, 
                        <a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Superman_(Clark_Kent)">Clark Kent</a>, is a mild-mannered reporter for the <a href="https://dc.fandom.com/wiki/Daily_Planet">Daily Planet</a> newspaper. 
                        He fights against evil and injustice as Superman, using his powers to protect the innocent and uphold the law.</p></dd></h2>
