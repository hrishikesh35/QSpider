Tables in html

we use "<table>" tag, in table tag we use "<tr>" tag and in that we use "<td>"

"style" attribute gives you the access to the CSS. (Border-collapses: collapses)
This CSS property is used to take out the spaces around the cells.

"cellpadding" attribute will increase the size of the cell.
it takes integers numbers as value.

"cellspacing" it increases the space around the cell.
We cannot use cellspacing with "Border-collapses: collapses".
