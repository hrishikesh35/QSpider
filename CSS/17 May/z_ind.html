        <h1>
            Superman possesses a wide range of superhuman abilities, 
            including super strength, speed, durability, and senses. 
            He can also fly, has heat vision, and can freeze objects with his breath. 
            His one major weakness is exposure to Kryptonite, 
            a radioactive element from his home planet that can weaken and even kill him.
