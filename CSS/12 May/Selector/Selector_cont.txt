*** SELECTORS ***

3. Psudo-class Selector
    a. link
        To change the default link color from blue (freashlink) to any other color we use Psudo class Selector.
        To change the color of fresh link we have the property called link.
        eg. 
            a:link
            {
                color: violet;
            }

    b. visited
        In default visited link gives purple color
        By using Psudo class Selector(visited) we can change the color of the visited link.
        eg.
            a:visited
            {
                color: red;
            }
    
    c. hover
        This property works when you hover on the elements y using the mouse curser.
        eg.
            a:hover
            {
                background-color: black;
            }
    
    d. active
        This active works on links and buttons 
        This represents weather your link or button is active orr not.

4. Psudo Element Selector (::)
    a. first-letter
        eg.
        p::first-letter
        {
            background-color: aqua;
        }

    b. first-line
        eg.
        p::first-line
        {
            background-color: blueviolet;
            color: brown;
        }

    c. before
        eg.
        h1::before
        {
            content: "Hello";
        }

    d. after
        eg.
        h1::after
        {
            content: "Hrishikesh.";
        }
